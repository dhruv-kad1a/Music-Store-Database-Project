# ðŸŽµ Music Store Database Project
## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to analyze a music store's data using SQL. The database schema represents a digital music store where we manage information about customers, employees, invoices, artists, albums, tracks, playlists, and genres.

# ðŸ—‚ Database Schema (ER Diagram)
The schema models a music store with relationships between artists, albums, tracks, invoices, and customers.

## Key Tables:
* Artist: Stores artist information (ArtistId, Name).
* Album: Albums linked to artists (AlbumId, Title, ArtistId).
* Track: Tracks in each album with details (TrackId, Name, AlbumId, GenreId, MediaTypeId, Milliseconds, UnitPrice).
* Genre: Music genre details (GenreId, Name).
* MediaType: Format of music (MediaTypeId, Name).
* Playlist & PlaylistTrack: Handles user playlists.
* Customer: Customer details (CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country, etc.).
* Employee: Employee details and reporting structure.
* Invoice & InvoiceLine: Purchases made by customers and their details.

The ER diagram shows the relationships:
* One artist has many albums.
* One album has many tracks.
* Tracks belong to genres and media types.
* Customers purchase tracks via invoices and invoice lines.
* Employees manage customers.

## ðŸ“Š SQL Queries & Business Insights
